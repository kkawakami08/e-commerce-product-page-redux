## Process

### Tools Used

- Mobile-first workflow
- React
- Redux / Redux Toolkit
- Next.js 13
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

This is my first project using Redux state management so it was challenging at first but was very beneficial in helping me understand how to use it, and how much easier Redux is with Redux Toolkit! I also used React state management (useState) for components that were passing a small amount of data as props.

### Project adjustments

- I added the total amount of the cart to the cart view
- I initalize the project with items already in the cart to show the cart's functionality is working
